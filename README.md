# neural_networks_from_scatch_python
Feedforward neural networks in python using only numpy!
This was my "Facharbeit" for my cs honours class in grammar school.
It basically is a "small paper".
The code is written in english.
The paper however, is only available in german.
main.py contains the implementation, as well as a small demonstration
of the key functions at the bottom. The functions and methods are
all commented/described. The implementation includes all
necessary components required for training a neural network,
such as f.e. an activation function and an implementation of both
a feedforward method and the backpropagation algorithm.
To run the demonstration example, please download the .csv-file
of the MNIST dataset from this website (https://www.python-course.eu/neural_network_mnist.php)
("Reading the MNIST data set"), place the files into the MNIST_data_csv-folder and run
csvToPklMNIST.py.

# Performance on MNIST
An exemplary neural network achieves a 95.16% test-accuracy after one training epoch.
